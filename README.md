## Mission

**theVector** is an independent open-source news and research platform focused on **IT security**, **data protection**, and **modern software development**.  
Our mission is to make **technical knowledge transparent, accurate, and freely accessible** — from in-depth analyses and investigative research to practical, reproducible projects.

Every article, report, and code sample is published under an **open license** and can be freely used, shared, and further developed.


## Focus Areas

- **IT News & Background Reports** – covering cybersecurity, open-source projects, and infrastructure development.  
- **Technical Analysis** – deep dives into architecture, vulnerabilities, and software trends.  
- **Tools & Research Updates** – weekly summaries on community projects, research, and new security tools.  
- **Privacy & Ethics** – discussion and analysis at the intersection of technology and society.

theVector stands for **technical precision**, **editorial depth**, and **transparency** — without paywalls, clickbait, or marketing-driven content.



## Team and Community

theVector is maintained by a distributed network of **writers, developers, and security researchers** dedicated to **open and verifiable IT reporting**.  
We welcome **community participation** through suggestions, issue reports, or pull requests — open technology journalism thrives on collaboration.
